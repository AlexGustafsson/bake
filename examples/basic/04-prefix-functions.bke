// Bake allows for prefix functions. Such a function is basically only
// a regular function that is ran before Bake resolves dependencies.
// A prefix function may be named anything, but when it's used, it's always prefixed with a dot.
// Such functions may be used to add tags to rules. Tags aren't always useful,
// but they act as a building block to provide functionality such as phony rules.
func ignore() {
  context.tags.add("my_tag")
