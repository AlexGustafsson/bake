# Bake <small>v0.1.0</small>

> A cross-platform language and tool for building things - a better Make

- A familiar syntax for Make users, but enable an even more general use with further scripting capabilities
- A uniform cross-platform experience without having to install Bake itself a la Gradle
- Enables users to create libraries for common actions, easily imported a la Go
- As fast as, or faster than Make
